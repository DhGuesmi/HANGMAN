# H A N G M A N!
## _A simple hangman game_

H A N G M A N is a regular hangman game  developed in python.
The game will choose a random english word and you will have to guess it before you die! (joke no one will!).

To quote wikipedia:
> Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game 
> for two or more players.
> One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence
> and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting 
> letters within a certain number of guesses.

## The game rules are simple:
- You have 7 lives and you have to guess a random word
- If you input a wrong letter you loose a life
- If you input the same wrong letter twice you won't loose a life as the game will remember it
- The game won't accept any non lowercase alpha characters

## Installation
To play the game you'll need to download both the python file and the txt file and have them in the same folder!
